SELECT Users.*
FROM Users
INNER JOIN UserTeams ON Users.UserID = UserTeams.UserID
WHERE UserTeams.TeamID = ?

^this will join a Users table and a Teams table. By using OAuth, we won't need to save their password


Users table:
User ID (Primary Key)
firstName
lastName
role
Email

Teams table:
Team ID (Primary Key)
Team Name (or company name?)

^somehow we need to associate a user to a company. Maybe in the settings tab on the frontend they can choose from a dropdown of one or two pre-set companies, which fetches that Team ID and ads them in the respected UserTeams table?


UserTeams (Join table for user-team relationships):
UserTeam ID (Primary Key)
User ID (Foreign Key, references Users)
Team ID (Foreign Key, references Teams)






SELECT Users.*
FROM Users
INNER JOIN Connections ON Users.UserID = Connections.`User B ID`
WHERE Connections.`User A ID` = <user_id>
^ this is for the teams tab to fetch connections in a connections table
